# easyjsr
easyjs runtime.

This is a work in progress and is currently not ready for use.

## usage
To use with `easyjs` you can set the runtime to `easyjsr`.

```bash
easyjs repl --runtime easyjsr
> @print('Hello World') // automatically includes all STD libs.
```

This is not ready yet and only supports VERY BASIC JS.
