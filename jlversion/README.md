# EasyJS JL Version
EasyJS was originally written in Julia. Due to wanting a binary and WASM support, I made the decision to convert the code into Rust.


This is the Julia Version. This version only reached v0.1.0 and supports

- fn
- lambdas as fn()
- call expressions
- math expressions (+-*/)
- if expressions
- for expressions
- variable 
- const variables
- javascript expressions

Feel free to add to the Julia version.
